#### Overview
Individual student project for Computational Methods in Health Informatics at George Mason University, Fall 2020. 

#### Motivation
According the Beryl Institute, a center for thought leadership in patient experience, "PX encompasses “All touch-points of people processes, policies, communications, actions and environment.” I was inspired by the US Department of Veterans Affairs' Patient Journey map, which highlights the impact of both clinical and non-clinical factors on the patient's emotions and sense of ease.

#### Project scenario
A healthcare system wants to improve PX for ambulatory office visits following poor reviews on social media, and to continue to monitor PX across its diverse population.

#### Approach
Synthetic patient survey data for a hypothetical healthcare system collected over four notional time periods.  Assumes 1 survey per patient and a 100% response rate, with all respondents being adults answering on their own behalf.  Survey responses and patient characteristics are randomly generated through the uniform, triangle and normal distributions. 

#### Products 
- Program to generate synthetic patient population 
- Programs to generate survey responses and place them on a likert scale
- Analytic tool for charts and survey response counts
- HTML code for notional website, PXCenter.html. 
- HTML code for child pages for hypothetical metrics for patient retention, willingness to recommend on social media, and breakdowns by gender, age, language and medical home.

#### Limitations
1. User cannot tailor views to look at interactively, a must for a professional setting.
2. More sophisticated graphics needed to appeal to professional audiences.
3. Randomly generated response parameters were somewhat arbitrary and could be very difficult to estimate if realism is important.
4. Additional business data and social media monitoring would also be needed to give a complete view of PX.

#### Utility
This tool includes many of the features a health system would need to start monitoring and improving PX around office visits:  a survey, an analytics program, and a web design. It could be readily adapted to demo designs to stakeholders.  Survey could be adapted to focus on telehealth, which poses increasingly important PX challenges.
