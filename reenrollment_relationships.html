<p>The data suggest that all surveyed topics affect desire to reenroll.  Parking, ease of using follow-up services like pharmacy and labs, 
and facility cleanliness/attractiveness stand out as key drivers warranting continued focus.</p>

<p>The charts below details how agreement with the statement, "I would recommend 
this center to friends/on social media" varies with responses to other survey questions. 
In all cases, "1" represents "Strongly Disagree" and 5 represents "Strongly Agree."</p><br>
